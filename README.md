# testcase-repo-alice

This project contains test requirements and test cases for Bob's solution.

## Test Requirements
- Validate the output of Bob's function.
- Ensure integration and performance are tested.

## Usage
To run tests against Bob's implementation:

1. Copy Bob's source code to the `src/` directory
2. Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
3. Run `npm run test` for basic test or `npm run test:all` for all tests

## Expected Structure for Testing
```
src/
├── algorithm.ts    # Bob's implementation should be here
├── utils.ts
└── index.ts
```
